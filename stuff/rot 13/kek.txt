heres the pythagorean theorem c = sqrt(a^2+b^2)
and now heres a hello world in C followed by a

now heres the first 4 sentences of Neuromancer:

"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned
to a dead channel.
`It's not like I'm using,' Case heard someone say, as he
shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the
Chat. `It's like my body's developed this massive drug deficiency.'
It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke. The Chatsubo
was a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there
for a week and never hear two words in Japanese."
